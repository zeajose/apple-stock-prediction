# Apple Stock Prediction
Stock prediction app using scikit learn and pandas

## How it works?
- If you are lazy like me go to this Colab instead of downloading the repository: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/140EGaYlEBK9yGj3_BiGqpAjz8eoc8GEv#scrollTo=-HAsphfeTqtS
- Run all the cells to see the predictions with four different algorithms.
- You can change the value "AAPL" for another stock like "TSLA" to see different results.
